## 📊 Tools Used

- *Python* (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) for data cleaning and feature engineering
- *Power BI Desktop* for data visualization and dashboard creation
- *Jupyter Notebook* for running EDA and preprocessing code

## 🧹 Data Preparation Steps

1. Loaded the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
2. Cleaned missing values in Age and Embarked
3. Created new features:
   - AgeGroup (e.g., Child, Teen, Adult)
   - FareGroup (Low, Medium, High)
   - Title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
4. Exported cleaned dataset as titanic_cleaned.csv for Power BI

## 📈 Visualizations Created in Power BI

- Bar chart: Survival by Gender
- Column chart: Survival by AgeGroup
- Pie chart: Survival by FareGroup
- Slicers for interactivity: Sex, Class (Pclass), AgeGroup
- Full dashboard view combining all insights

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate
- Children and young adults survived more often than older passengers
- Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more

## ✅ Conclusion

Power BI revealed strong survival patterns in Titanic data based on gender, class, and age. This interactive dashboard allows easy exploration of the dataset and demonstrates how data storytelling helps in understanding real-world events.
